The model outperforms an autoregressive model with 2 lags (AR(2)), and a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model over all horizons, a factor model on horizons longer than 2 periods ahead, and the median forecast of the Survey of Professional Forecasters at 5 quarters ahead. Forecasts over different time windows, model specifications, along with Monte Carlo simulations suggest the performance of our model is robust and reproducible. Additionally, our tests show performance does not depend significantly on initialization of parameters, reasonable changes in architecture, and noise due to stochastic optimization. Forecasts evaluation across countries also suggests this model is able to successfully forecast GDP across many different policy regimes, jointly.","tags":["Deep Learning","Recurrent Neural Networks","Time Series Econometrics","Macroeconomic Forecasting"],"title":"GDP Forecasting using Recurrent Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cameron Fen","Zhengyuan Cui"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.
